# Exam Eligibility Rules

## Purpose
Define the rules that determine which exams an auditor can purchase. The eligibility decision must be explainable and auditable.

## Eligibility Inputs
- Good standing status (membership and ethics)
- Exam progression history (passed prerequisites)
- Unpaid invoice status
- Renewal compliance status

## Decision Rules
- Block purchase when membership is not in good standing.
- Enforce progression sequence unless an exemption exists.
- Block purchase when any unpaid invoice is outstanding.
- Block purchase when renewal is overdue beyond the grace period.

## Audit Notes
Eligibility responses must include a short reason code so that support teams can explain the outcome quickly.
